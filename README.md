# Financial-Fraud-Detection-Hugging-Face

## Introduction

This project aims to automatically detect financial fraud using advanced machine learning techniques. The model leverages datasets from Hugging Face and utilizes sophisticated methods such as LightGBM for classifying fraudulent financial activities. The primary objective of this project is to provide an accurate and reliable solution for identifying potential fraud in transaction data.

## Features

- **Utilization of Hugging Face Datasets**: The model is trained on a well-structured dataset from Hugging Face, which includes labeled transaction data for fraud detection.
- **Advanced Model Architecture**: This project uses advanced models like LightGBM for feature extraction and classifying transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes essential steps such as normalization and feature engineering to improve the model's accuracy.

## Model

- LightGBM is used in this project for detecting financial fraud.
